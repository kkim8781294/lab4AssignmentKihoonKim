## Data Preprocessing Project — Kihoon Kim  

### What / Why  
This project was completed to improve **data preprocessing skills** through practical exercises.  
It focuses on understanding and applying techniques for **data tidying, cleaning, and outlier detection** using real datasets.  

- **Goal:**  
  To develop the ability to preprocess raw data effectively — from restructuring and cleaning to detecting outliers and visualizing insights.  

- **Why (Practice Focus):**  
  - Convert **wide-format data** to **tidy format** using the `melt()` function  
  - Perform **data preprocessing** and **data cleaning**  
  - Apply **outlier detection** (Z-score, IQR)  
  - Create **visualizations** for analytical interpretation
